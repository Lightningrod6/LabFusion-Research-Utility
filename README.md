# LabFusion-Research-Utility
Personal Research project to learn about the Unity Engine, Steam Networking while creating a utility tool for the mod "BoneLab Fusion"

---
# Purpose of This
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Unity Engine with an added bonus of Steam Networking. Game used for this was BoneLab, which is a game that demonstrates the capabilities of the physics engine "Marrow" created by SLZ. Many mods have been created for this game both script mods and asset mods. This project used a mod called "BoneLab Fusion" which is a mod that adds multiplayer to BoneLab which is mainly a single player game. The mod primarly uses Steam Networking for its multiplayer purpose. What I did was this mod was trying to learn off it and develop my own mod that interacts with both Unity and Steam and since then I have learned quite a lot.

# Answering Questions Before They Are Asked
Some questions that may be asked:
1. "Why are you open sourcing this?" 
2. "Some of these features look dangerous, why don't you remove them?"
3. "Are there any viruses?"

5. "Are you going to update this?"
6. "How can I compile this or set this up"

Answers:
1. To share my knowledge with the world and what I have learned during the past few months
2. No one in the real world was harmed or emotional strained from these features, these are simply harmless
3. If there we're any viruses, then this wouldn't be open sourced. You may check the code yourself
4. Unfortunately yes, people on the LabFusion discord complained and I got banned, its not a big deal but people outed it as a big issue.
5. No updates will be provided, this is public for people to use for their own projects. I take no responsibility if this is used incorrectly or modified.
6. I will not be providing information on how to compile or set this up, you can follow the guide on the [Melon Loader Wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/)
